              however be warned, if you leave blankets/tarps or chairs in this
              transtional zone, they will be folded up and set aside in order to
              make room for the current audience members. please see the concert
              bowl map for the location of the area, look for markers on the
              field. or ask one of our festival hosts to find where your objects
              are located.

            <h3>boogie zone and evening dance times</h3>
            <p>
              dancing is encouraged at our festival, but we also want to keep an
              clear view for our seated audience members. we want to make sure
              sure our festivals work for everyone, with this in mind, a larger
              boogie zone has been created on the sides of the concert bowl
              stage. clar markers have been installed on those areas, dancing
              directly in front of the stage is not permitted for most of the
              show until we hit the evening when we have dance-oriented bands on
              stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              each night, the markers will come down and the front of our
              concert bowl stage will become an dance floor at the specific
              times listed to the left updated when our line-up is complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              please respect each other and these guidelines as we try to make
              our festival work for everyone. if you had saved yourself an seat
              at the front of the stage and don't want to dance, then please
              move back into the areas where pepole are still sitting.
