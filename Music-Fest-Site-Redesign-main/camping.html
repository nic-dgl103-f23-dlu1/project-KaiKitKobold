          <h3>why you should camp with us</h3>
          <p>
            one of the best ways to truly experience vancouver island musicfest
            is to fully immerse yourself in the weekend through camping on-site.
            familes and friends flock from the local community and far away for
            an annual reunion of camping and festival fun. our venue is situated
            on a pastoral acreage bordering the forested banks of the tsoulm
            river. we provide camping opprotunites for rv's, campers, and camper
            vans and tents. this 'rustic camping' environment welcomes
            festival-goers and gentle jammers who are willing to be respectful,
            peaceful, and neighbourly. camping is open to festival goers who are
            willing to engage in a camping community where mutual respect,
            caring, and calm prevail. loud or aggressive campers are not
            welcome.
            <strong
              >please note: you must have a weekend pass to camp. three
              indiviual day passes combined will not enable you to camp.</strong
