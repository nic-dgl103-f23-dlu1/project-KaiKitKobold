This project is a mock-up of a website, chosen from a list as part of an HTML/CSS: from a North Island College course, the site I decided to remake is the Vancouver Island 
Music Fest website, it's a mixture of the post-2023 festival and the current 2023 Christmas Sale, which may look an tad odd to an outside observer.
