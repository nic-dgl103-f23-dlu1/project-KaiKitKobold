This Project was created for an Finals Project for my HTML/CSS, Class in which we redesign an website, and attempt to make it more up to date, in design and in general. I chose 
The Music Fest Website. 

Project is pretty outdated, and there are many aspects that are lacking, it's very overdesiged, has bad CSS and terrible formating, however I keep this up to show how I've grown as an
developer.
